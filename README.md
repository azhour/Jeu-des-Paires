# Jeu-des-Paires

## Instructions:

Display 14 hidden cards on the screen. When the player clicks on a card he reveals its contents.
When he clicks on a second card, if it is identical the previous one the two cards remain
face up, otherwise the cards are new masked.
Goal is to find all the pairs and that the cards are all face up.

Bonus: add a timer and test counter to the application and make sure the user can not
not disturb the running of the script.
